Shroud allows you to load Python modules in a ``require()`` style.

.. code:: python

    from shroud import require
    status = require('lib/status')
    status.yell()

This is particularly useful in Python applications with a plugin
architecture and solves potential problems when using traditional Python
modules that can easily result in dependency conflicts.

  Loads a Python module by filename. Can fall back to bytecode cache file

    suffix the Python module must but a file, otherwise it can also be a
    directory of which the ``__init__.py`` file is loaded.
  :param directory: The directory to consider *path* relative to. If omitted,
    it will be read from the calling stackframe's globals.
  :param reload: If this parameter is True, the module will be reloaded if
    it was already loaded.
  :param cascade: If this parameter and *reload* is True, the reload will
    be cascaded to subsequent :func:`require` calls inside the module that
    is being reloaded (ultimately reloading everything). During a cascade
    reload, these parameters have no effect even when passed explicitly.
